COM_MINIORANGE_IMPORTEXPORTUSERS_PLUGIN_OVERVIEW="Plugin Overview"
COM_MINIORANGE_IMPORTEXPORTUSERS_PLUGIN_OVERVIEW_TEXT="The Joomla Import Export Users plugin allows you to import and export Joomla Users from one Joomla site to another. It lets you migrate to a new website without losing your users or customers, quite literally. You can import or export user/customer data using CSV files. This plugin helps you to import and export the bulk Joomla users using a CSV file."
COM_MINIORANGE_IMPORTEXPORTUSERS_PLUGIN_OVERVIEW_TEXT1="Your Joomla users can be imported and exported from Joomla 3.x to Joomla 4.x, Joomla 5.x and Joomla 6.x and vice versa. Additionally, you can import users from any other websites or CMS into your Joomla website."
COM_MINIORANGE_IMPORTEXPORTUSERS_PLUGIN_OVERVIEW_TEXT2="Currently you are on the free version and this plugin is only for POC purposes. You can only export the users in the .CSV format using this plugin. If you want to import these users you will require license version of the plugin."
COM_MINIORANGE_IMPORTEXPORTUSERS_PLUGIN_WORK="How does this plugin (Extension) work?"
COM_MINIORANGE_IMPORTEXPORTUSERS_PLUGIN_OVERVIEW_TEXT3="The Import-Export Joomla Users Plugin takes CSV file as input. You must create a CSV file and upload it. This is to match each field of CSV file to the field of particular user fields, otherwise, Admin needs to input manually. For example, the username field gets mapped to the Username. For the plugin to work correctly, you must map the headers of all the columns correctly and you must ensure that all of the fields you enter are in the correct format. You can create the CSV from scratch or you can export the users to get the format of the CSV. You can use a spreadsheet program, such as Microsoft Excel, OpenOffice, Libre Office, or Google Spreadsheets for creating and modifying the CSV file. Save this file in UTF-8 encoding with extension .CSV. After entering all details about users in a spreadsheet, you can bulk import users to Joomla. With this plugin, you can also export and download user details as a CSV file."
